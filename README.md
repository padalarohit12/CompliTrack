## 🚀 The Problem
Small businesses don’t fail compliance because they don’t care. They fail because:
*   Deadlines are scattered across GST, licenses, insurance, and contracts.
*   Reminders live in Excel, WhatsApp, or someone’s head.
*   Penalties are instant and expensive.

## 🛡️ The Solution
**CompliTrack** replaces broken systems with one source of truth.
*   **Centralized Visibility**: Track everything in one place.
*   **Automated Reminders**: Get notified before it’s too late.
*   **Proof of Tracking**: Eliminate "I forgot" from your vocabulary.

## ✨ Features
*   **Midnight/Cosmic UI**: Stunning, accessible, high-contrast interface designed for professionals.
*   **Glassmorphism Dashboard**: Modern aesthetic that feels premium and reliable.
*   **Framer Motion**: Smooth, cinematic interactions.

*   **Secure Auth**: Enterprise-grade security via Supabase.
